This directory contains old code from my attempts to use Q-Law in a continuation scheme for indirect trajectory optimization
but was not able to get it working.  

The qLaw directory also contains all of the code used for the original Astrodynamics Specialist paper
and first submission submitted to IEEE TAES on Q-Law with a sun-angle constraint
